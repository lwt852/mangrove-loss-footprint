The Matlab code provided is designed for papers related to mangrove loss footprint calculation, analysis, and visualization. It is compatible with MATLAB R2021a and consists of three distinct runs:

Run_1: This section calculates the ratio of three drivers related to mangrove forest loss based on the Eora database from 2000 to 2016. The Eora database can be downloaded from [here](https://worldmrio.com/eora/). This process usually takes 10mins.

Run_2: This section calculates the mangrove loss footprint and determines the loss driven by the consumption of different countries. Each section within this run needs to be executed sequentially. This process usually takes 1 min.

Run_3: This section prepares the necessary code for visualization of the results. This process usually takes 1 min.

Each part of the code should be executed one after the other to ensure proper data processing and visualization.
